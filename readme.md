### Comprehensive Setup
P3F CEP contains **every tool** needed to set up and play P3F with mods, along with step-by-step instructions for setup and additional tips and tricks.

This includes a pre-configured copy of the **PCSX2 emulator**.

### Faithful Enhancements
P3F CEP includes **several enhancement mods** that improve on the base game in a variety of ways. Whether it's improved textures, combat rebalancing, or just making the textbox prettier, these mods make for a better first or five hundredth playthrough of P3F.

There are also a few **cheat sheet mods**, intended to let players experience everything on repeat playthroughs without having to look up a guide. *We don't recommend using these your first time playing!*

### Customization
P3F CEP includes the **Aemulus Package Manager** program to make customization easy. All of the mods in P3F CEP can be individually enabled or disabled with Aemulus, and it's easy for users to **add additional mods** to their loadout without having to manually merge files.

### Compatibility
P3F CEP is **fully compatible with unmodded P3F save data** and does not affect story progression. You do not need to start a new game before using P3F CEP.

### Ease of Access
P3F CEP is intended to be accessible for beginners to modding. It contains detailed instructions and illustrations, and the team runs an active **[Discord server](https://discord.gg/aZkkqnw)** where you can get update notifications and request support. Everything is neatly organized to encourage good practice when modding games.
